# BeeJee test task

Npm install and then npm run start

I want to improve many things, but I have no time. Mainly requests with errors. 
Also I want to break a lot of things into components to reuse them later. 
Some data could be moved into redux. For example list of tasks.

## Design is awful and markup is disgusting. I know it

##Also I would like to remove as many warning as possible


I wanted to make as many small reusable components as possible.
